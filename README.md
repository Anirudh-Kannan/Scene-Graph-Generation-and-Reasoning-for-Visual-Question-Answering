# Scene Graph Generation and Reasoning for Visual Question Answering

Abstract:
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a challenging task that aims to develop machine learning algorithms capable of answering questions about visual content. However, VQA presents significant difficulties, particularly in the need for advanced reasoning and the ability to handle complex questions. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates scene graphs into LXMERT, a state-of-the-art VQA Model. Our approach leverages the rich context provided by scene graphs, which captures the relationships between objects, to enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of LXMERT. Our analysis of experimental results reveals that incorporating scene graphs as context into \textsc{lxmert} yields a significant improvement in its performance on VQA tasks.
